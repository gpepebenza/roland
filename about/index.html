          <h2>Born from a simple, frustrating problem.</h2>
          <p>GripNex was created to solve a simple but common problem: athletes losing stability because their feet slip inside their shoes. After noticing how this affected performance and caused blisters or small injuries, we decided to design a sock that improves grip, comfort, and confidence in any sport. GripNex started as a small idea and became a commitment to support athletes with better, smarter gear.</p>
